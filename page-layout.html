                    <h2 align="left">What is a WEB Designing?</h2>
                    <p align="left">Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way
                    that is functional and offers a good user experience. <b>User experience</b> is central to the web designing process. Websites
                    have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate. Web designing essentially involves working
                    on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users
                    to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how
                    well the website is designed.</p>
                    <h2 align="left">What Do Web Designers Do?</h2>
                    <p align="left">Web designers create the design and layout of a website with their technical expertise and knowledge while keeping in
                    mind the client’s requirements. They have a deep understanding of <b>UI (user interface)</b> and <b>UX (user experience)</b> and are
                    adept at using design programs for creating visual elements. With their skills and expertise, web designers capture the
                    brand’s identity in the design elements of the website.

                    <h2 align="left">Key Benefits of Having a Good Web Design </h2>
                    <p>A good web design can transform how your brand speaks to your audience. Organizations focus on their web design more
                        than ever and look for professional web designers for the apparent benefits it can offer. Some of these benefits
                        include:</p>
                    <h3 align="center">An Impactful First Impression</h3>
                    <p align="left">Web designing has a variety of elements that are capable of bestowing your website with better Google
                        rankings. Some of
                        these elements include readability, mobile-friendliness, website speed, sitemaps, URL structure, and website
                        navigation.
                        A good web design has these elements incorporated into the website, which gives you greater visibility both for your
                        audience and the search engine.</p>
                    <h3 align="center">Brand Consistency</h3>
                    <p align="left"align="left">Several key assets of your brand, such as the logo, color scheme, and fonts can ensure your audience
                        remembers your
                        brand and easily differentiates it from thousands of others. A professional web designer takes into account all the
                        unique aspects of your business and blends them into your website to add to your brand credibility and portray
                        consistency.</p>

                        <p align="left" align="left">A good website is one that displays a careful balance between appearance and functionality. When your website is
                        aesthetically pleasing but fails to offer the information or help your audience with what it looks for, the aesthetics
                        cannot make up for the lack of functionality and vice versa. Therefore, web design comprises two broad key elements—aesthetic or visual elements and functional elements—that are of equal importance to make your website stand
                        out.</p>
                        <h3 align="center">Visual Elements</h3>
                        <p align="left">Visual elements come together and set a theme for your website, which leaves a great impact on visitors when you get it right.<br> It is crucial that every element compliments one another and looks harmonious rather than chaotic. Visual
                        elements include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Fonts</b></li>
                            <li><b>Colors</b></li>
